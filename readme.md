# Fine Wine
This is a project based dataset of Wine from various countries and redering the information about their wineries. In this project, we have used Mongodb Atlas as our database, Flask for the backend and HTML Jinja Templates for Frontend. The main motive of the project is to dynamically fetch all the information from the Mongodb Database and display it with interactive properties. 

## Usability
* Set virtual environment by writing following code in command prompt
> pip install venv (virtual environment name)

> virtual environment name can be of your choice
* app.py is the main python file that you will run after installing virtual environment.
* Lib directory contains python libraries
* Static directory has all the images and css files used for UI
* Template directory has all the html files
* pyenv configuration source file contains the environment required for flask.

## Tech Stack:
* HTML Jinja Templates (FrontEnd)
* Flask (Backend)
* Mongodb Atlas (Database)

## Features of the Model:
* Retrieving the data from Mongodb. 
* Making interactive UI for displaying more details.
* Inserting comments to the database.
* Retrieving the images from the database.
* Other features for searching the information about different wines such as:
>Searching by the keyword using Regular Expressions

>Sorting by the price

>Searching with the Coordinates
